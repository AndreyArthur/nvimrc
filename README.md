## My Personal Neovim Configuration

This config was written from scratch by myself, it provides lsp support, completion, a fantastic syntax highlighting, file tree, fuzzy finding, git integration and the most important, a fancy appearance for neovim.

## Plugins that I use

- `Lazy` - The plugin manager itself.
- `Fugitive && GitSigns` - Provides git integration.
- `Telescope` - Provides live grep, fuzzy finding, buffers navigation, etc.
- `LuaLine` - Fancy info lines.
- `Treesitter` - Provides awesome syntax highlighting.
